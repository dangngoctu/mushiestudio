                            I set the ‘DETAIL' as the key idea throughout the section and the key message that readers will take out.
                            The writing style is friendly, truthful because I want the readers to understand, feel & live the experience of design clothing of Mushie.
                            Word count: 177 as I believe it would be the right length to capture and keep readers with us.

                            Hubert de Givenchy once said ‘Luxury is in each detail’ 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            We believe no detail is too small to matter; each manifests on its own to create a whole luxury, high quality piece of clothing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            At Mushie Studio, we value nothing but quality & high quality only; therefore, we set Detail as the guidance in design, creation & service with no compromise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            At Mushie Studio, it does not matter if it costs much time or effort, the only thing matters is the details in our pieces. We are allowed to be contented only when we found the right silk for your dresses, the right buttons for your shirts, the right threads for your trousers, or the right design for your preferences and many other details we are working on at the moment. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            At Mushie Studio, we believe all women are flawless creation of God. They deserve to look and dress their best under all circumstances. Bear that in mind, we would like to perfection closer to our collection & through our collection, we would bring you closer to comfort and confidence. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            We hope when you come to Mushie Studio, you would find the detail for your outfit.
